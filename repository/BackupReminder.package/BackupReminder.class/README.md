I am the BackupRemainder, I try to remaind you to do your backups.

My #lastBackupFile inst. var. contains the reference to the file from which the date of the last backup can be retrieved. By default, it is /var/log/last_backup.

#timeSinceLastBackup uses this file to determinate the duration between the last backup date and now.
